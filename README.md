# FoodIT
Google Solution Challenge

This is the application which is meant to be targeted to the international students. We gathered some surveys from the students and faced the same problem which is why we came up with this idea.

### Problem Statement:
International students faced many difficulties with logistics like finding a place for rent and adjusting to the new environment and society. Within these challenges they also face lack of information on food and groceries. Moreover, the first thing a student misses is his food from his homeland. Furthermore, there are some dietary issues concerning some group of students. Like Muslims and Jews are only take Koshir meat which is not available easily in non-muslim countries.


### Solution:
We provide a platform for students or anyone who wants to taste food from their origin. It's a Knowledge sharing app where a user can insert a food item and a place to share it with other hungry and sad explorers. It can reduce your search for such favorite items and deliver you with all the nostalgic items within a few clicks.

We also used some proper validation through which the app can be more secure and relevant by introducing FireBase Vision API to validate the image to be only a food item. This helps us to stop spams in our app. The concert is still fresh and may have some corner cases unattended.


#### Step to build an app:
- The code base is provided in a repository which can be imported to Android Studio and can simply be build with build option
- It will create an APK file which can be uploaded to a mobile phone to be used
- You need to create an account to utilize an app and the instructions are within the app can guide you
- If you want to use an app without building you can use APK file in the repository, ready to be used.
